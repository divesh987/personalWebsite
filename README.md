## Website Choice
For my website, I decided to create a website based on myself which would display certain things about me including a gallery and a unique way of showing my hobbies. I have chosen this approach for my first website because it alllows me to display my personality in an interactive way. The fact that it will be responsive also allows mobile users to view my website in a suitable format. 

## WireFrames 
Before developing my website, it was important to create wireframes for both **mobile** and **desktop** formats so that I am able to visualise and come up with the structure of my web application before diving into the code without knowing what to create. This is an important step of the web development process because as well as the developer benefitting from visualising the structure, it also allows the developer to present their wireframes to clients in an excellent manner.
